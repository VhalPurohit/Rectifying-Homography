# Rectifying-Homography

Contains an ipynb doing the following

1) Performing camera calibration by finding corners
2) Mark a bundle of parallel lines (would use OpenCV to do it automatically if I could do it again)
3) Calculate lever vectors and normals to the XYZ planes for an image
4) Calculate and apply a rectifying homography
